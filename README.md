## Pair Programming project - Elysa W

1. Iteration 3 did not provide an interaction pattern. How did you approach designing this iteration? If you did not get to Iteration 3, reflect on how you think you wouldâ€™ve approached the design and problem solving process.
> I approached iteration 3 by first breaking down each section (i.e. main menu, setup, turn, etc.) into smaller parts and then using those small parts I started writing tests.  With each test I considered what attributes and logic I would need to be able to pass the test and complete that function.  I did a lot of my thinking in a text window mapping out my own mini version of an interaction pattern.  This seemed to help me get a clearer idea of what I was trying to accomplish through each part of iteration 3.

2. If you had one more day to work on this project, what would you work on?
> If I had one more day to work on this project, I would first finish writing the play method and the necessary calls in the runner.  I'm hoping that if I complete those two parts the game would function for the most part.  I would also seek help in writing tests for methods that return unpredictable values.  I am very confused how to determine an expected value if I don't even know what the method will output, despite this being by design.

3. Describe the pairing techniques you used while working on this project.
> While I was still working with a partner, we used the "Driver-Navigator" techinique and attempted switch roles several times.  This was mostly productive.  We also attempted to use the "Ping-pong" technique, but this proved to be increasingly difficult as I was frequently unable to reach my partner.

4. Describe how feedback was shared over the course of this project.
> At this point, I can only speak for myself.  In numerous instances, I focused on giving coding feedback in a caring and empathetic way as we worked through our Driver-Navigator sessions.  I made effort to not make a big fuse out of differences in coding styles.  If it worked, that didn't matter.  Unfortunately, I had to reach out to my instructor and end working on the project together. I finished the rest of this project on my own.
